	<h3 style="text-align:center;">Planning</h3>
	<p>Nothing is more exciting and relaxing at the same time than going on a dream vacation. However, before you go you need to figure out:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>How do I get there?</li> 
		<li>What airline do I take?</li> 
		<li>Which airport(s) will I travel to?</li> 
		<li>Do I have to spend a night at the airport</li>
		<li>Where should I lodge?</li>
		<li>How do I travel to and from different destinations?</li>
		<li>How long do I plan to stay at each locale?</li>
		<li>What are my dinning options?</li>
		<li>What is my budget?</li>
		<li>How will different options impact my budget?</li>
		<li>Can I use credit card, or do I need to exchange local currency?</li>
		<li>Do I need to hire a tour guide, or will the locals understand enough English for me to navigate the city?</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Before you say to yourself "Forget this" and throw your hands in the air in frustration before the daunting task of trip planning, read on to consider different trip planning tools that would make your trip planning more manageable, or even enjoyable.</p>

   <h3 style="text-align:center;">Research Your Options</h3>
   <p>The name "Big Sur" has its origins in the area's early Spanish history. While the Portolá expedition was exploring Alta California, they arrived at San Carpóforo Canyon near present-day San Simeon on September 13, 1769. Unable to penetrate the difficult terrain along the coast, they detoured inland through the San Antonio and Salinas Valleys before arriving at Monterey Bay, where they founded Monterey and named it the provincial capital.</p>

   <h3 style="text-align:center;">Decide Where You  Want To Go</h3>
   <p>Defining where you want to go sets a goal to work toward. A lot of people talk vaguely about travel. They never say where they are going, just that they are going. Picking a destination is immensely important, as it gives you a definite goal. It’s a lot easier to mentally get behind “I am going to Paris” than “I’m going to Europe” or “I’m going somewhere.” Not only will your trip become more concrete for you and easier to commit to, but it will make planning easier as well…because you know what to work towards.</p>
	
	<h3 style="text-align:center;">Decide the Length of Your Trip</h3>
   <p></p>
	
	<h3 style="text-align:center;"></h3>
   <p>How much does it cost to travel? I have no idea without knowing for how long you’re going away. You can’t figure out how much you need to save if you haven’t decided on how long you’ll be in your destination. After you say “I’m going to Paris,” add “for 10 days.”</p>

	<p>Now, you have a concrete plan to work from. “I am going to Paris for 10 days” is a trip that you can plan for.</p>
	
	<h3 style="text-align:center;">Research Your Costs</h3>
   <p>So you know where you’re going and how long you’ll be there, but to really nail down how much money you need, your next task is to research the costs in your destination at the style of travel you want. Do you want to backpack, or would you rather stay in luxury hotels? How much are hostels, hotels, restaurants, and attractions? Knowing will allow you to estimate how much money you’ll need for your trip. Here is how to research costs:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Buy a guidebook.</li>
		<li>Research online about your destination, such as blogs, Facebook group and any other reputable websites.</li>
		<li>Google prices for specific things you want to do.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>You don’t need to do more than that. There’s so much information on the web that if you go down the rabbit hole of overplanning, you’ll get lost and confused by the firehose of information. Stick to those four things and you’ll be set!</p>
	
	<h3 style="text-align:center;">Start Saving Money</h3>
   <p>Write down all your current expenses so you can determine where you are spending money and how you can cut back. People bleed a lot of money every day through small purchases: that bottle of water, the dollar for that snack, that extra coffee. All of that adds up and creating this breakdown can let you know where you need to cut and save.</p>

	<p>For example, if you need $2,000 USD for the trip you’re taking in eight months, that means you only have to save $8.33 per day. Couldn’t you find a way to save $8 per day? Heck, your daily coffee is most of that!</p>

	<h3 style="text-align:center;">Book Your Accommodation</h3>
   <p>If you have a set schedule, feel free to book accommodation for the duration of your trip, but if you are going to be traveling long-term, book just the first few days. Once you know the dates you’ll be in your destination, there is no real reason not to find a place to stay. My view is that waiting will just lead to you losing your top picks.</p>
	
	<h3 style="text-align:center;">Tell Your Card Companies You’re Traveling</h3>
   <p>No matter how long you’ll be gone, it’s a good idea to let your credit card companies know you will be overseas; that way any transactions that you make aren’t flagged as fraudulent and your card is less likely to be blocked. There’s nothing worse than having to sit on the phone with your credit card company instead of enjoying your vacation.</p>	
	
	<h3 style="text-align:center;">Pack And Enjoy Your Trip!</h3>
   <p>Pack light, and go on your trip and have fun! Head to the airport, board your plane (don’t forget your passport!), and enjoy the fruits of your labor. You’ve worked hard to get here. If you’re feeling nervous, don’t worry — that’s perfectly normal! You’re about to embark on an amazing adventure. Trust your planning, follow your instincts, and you’ll have the trip of a lifetime. I guarantee it.</p>
